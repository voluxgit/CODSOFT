💼 Project Introduction:
This project aimed to predict customer churn for a bank, utilizing a dataset from Kaggle.
The analysis involved data preprocessing, exploratory visualization, and model training.

📊 Data Handling and Exploration:
Loaded the dataset and conducted initial exploratory analysis.
Examined data shape, checked for duplicates, missing values, and reviewed data types.
Visualized correlations between features using heatmap.
Inspected unique values in each column and visualized feature distributions.

🔍 Exploratory Visualization:
Created count plots and histograms to visualize categorical and numerical features.
Explored relationships between different features and churn using count plots.

🛠️ Data Preprocessing:
Performed feature selection and transformation, including label encoding and one-hot encoding.
Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y) variables for model training.

🧠 Model Training and Evaluation:
Trained three different classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
Evaluated model performance using confusion matrices, accuracy, and classification reports.


📊 Model Evaluation and Tuning:
Conducted an in-depth evaluation of model performance using confusion matrices and classification reports.
Cross-validated the models to assess their generalization across different folds.

Fine-tuned hyperparameters through Grid Search, optimizing Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models.
Achieved improved accuracy levels and enhanced model effectiveness.
