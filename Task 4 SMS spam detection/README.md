🔍 Project Introduction:
The focus was on developing a predictive model to identify spam SMS messages accurately using machine learning and NLP tools.

💼 Data Acquisition and Exploration:
The project commenced with data collection from a Kaggle dataset and loading it into the environment.
Exploratory analysis and visualization offered insights into data distribution and relationships.

📊 Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
Data preprocessing encompassed cleaning, stemming, and transformation of SMS messages.
Features like the number of characters, words, and sentences were engineered to enrich the dataset.

📈 Exploratory Data Visualization:
Utilized Word Clouds to visualize the most frequent words in both spam and ham (non-spam) messages.
Analyzed common words in spam and ham messages, facilitating the understanding of their characteristics.

🛠️ Model Building and Evaluation:
Employed several classifiers including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.
Rigorously evaluated model performance using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and classification reports.

🔍 K-Fold Cross Validation:
Employed k-Fold Cross Validation to assess the models' stability and effectiveness across different data folds.
Obtained average accuracy and standard deviation, indicating the models' consistency and reliability.
